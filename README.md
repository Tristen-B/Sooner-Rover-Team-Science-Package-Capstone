# Sooner-Rover-Team-Science-Package-Capstone
A Compilation of my experience working on the design of a new science package for the Sooner Rover Team

The Sooner Rover Team is a multi-disciplinary comptetition team from the University of Oklahoma. We compete in the University Rover Challenge, a competition meant to simulate Mars conditions for a rover to navigate, manipulate and study.
The competition is broken up into multiple missions. These are the Extreme Delivery, Equipment Servicing, Science, and Autonomous missions.
Each of these missions has different capability requirements for the rover, so the Sooner Rover Team Designed multiple modules that can be switched out for each mission that attach to the base rover.
